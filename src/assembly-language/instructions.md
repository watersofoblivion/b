# Instructions

There are a handful instructions available to use when writing programs.  I've
divided them up into 3 categories to make them more digestable: Arithmetic,
Load-Store, and Flow Control.

Additionally, there is the special instruction `halt`.  This instruction simply
tells the CPU to stop executing and marks the end of a program.  It is written:

```assembly
halt
```
